# cifar10
This is a neural network built in Python that analyzes the CIFAR-10 dataset using Pytorch. Project for my 9th grade final exam.
It was originally created in 2019 but the notebook metadata was recently updated so it can be viewed correctly on GitHub.

The original file can still be used when downloaded and opened in any code editor.
